Version 0.16.0 of Cake has been released, and it's a big release!

Not only are we supporting the full .NET framework (*v4.5*), but from this version
we will also support running Cake on platforms capable of running .NET Core (*netstandard1.6*).

For this to work, you will have to install the `Cake.CoreCLR` package instead
of the normal `Cake` package. A blog post describing this more in detail
will be published soon.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
