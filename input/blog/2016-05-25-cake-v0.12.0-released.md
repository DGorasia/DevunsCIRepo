Version 0.12.0 of Cake has been released.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but...

This is a huge release for Cake!  In this release we have added support for the debugging of Cake scripts using Visual Studio, as well as support for the .Net CLI Tools (a.k.a. dotnet).  The best part about both of these features is that they were contributed again by our amazing community members.  Thank you, we very much appreciate your help!

In addition to these amazing features, we also took the time to squash some bugs, as well as to improve our own builds through the use of [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), which is helping with NuGet issues on our Travis CI Builds.

Keep an eye out on the blog and on the Cake website for additional information about the new debugging support and how it can be used.
