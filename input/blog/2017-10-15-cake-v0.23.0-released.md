Version 0.23.0 has been released!

This release contains three new features specially worth highlighting and a lot of bugfixes and improvements.

# Asynchronous Tasks

Cake now supports asynchronous tasks. This will let you use the `async` and `await` C# features within a task.

Tasks will still execute single threaded and in order as before, but this really simplifies asynchronous programming and utilizing asynchronous APIs within your Cake scripts.

```csharp
Task("Copy-To-Memory-Async")
    .Does(async () => {
    IFile file = Context.FileSystem.GetFile("./test.txt");
    using(Stream
            inputStream = testFile.OpenRead(),
            outputStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await inputStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
        await outputStream.FlushAsync();
        Information("Copied {0} bytes into memory.",
            outputStream.Length
            );
    }
});
```

# Reverse task dependencies

Ever wished you could define your task as a dependency of another task - i.e. a reversed dependency relationship? The good news is that you now can.

```csharp
Task("A").IsDependeeOf("B");
Task("B");

RunTarget("B");
```

Since task `A` is configured to be a dependee of `B` the task definition will be identical to the following:

```csharp
Task("A");
Task("B").IsDependentOn("A");

RunTarget("B");
```

# Optional or required task dependencies

You can now explicitly specify whether or not a dependency (or dependee) is optional or required.
This is useful if you want to create "extension points" in your build script.

```csharp
Task("Bar").IsDependencyOf("Foo", required: true);
Task("Baz").IsDependencyOf("Qux", required: false)
```

In the above example, `Bar` is dependent on `Foo` while `Baz` is dependent on `Qux`.
The difference between the two dependencies above is that Cake will throw an exception if no task called `Foo` was found.
