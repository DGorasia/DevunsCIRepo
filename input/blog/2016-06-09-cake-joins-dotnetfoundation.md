It’s been an amazing journey since the push of the first public commit of Cake in May 2014, in just two years we’ve seen 72 releases, had more than 60 contributors, over a thousand issues and pull requests proposed. And on top of that a small eco system of more than 50 community provided Cake addins.

So firstly a huge thank you to all our contributors and adopters! This wouldn’t have been possible without you! It’s truly amazing to see the increase in contribution and adoption of Cake.

Today we’re really excited and happy to share that Cake is joining the .NET foundation!

So what does this mean for Cake? It’ll still be maintained and governed by the same team as now, but with the support and guidance of the .NET foundation, ensuring the longevity of the project.
