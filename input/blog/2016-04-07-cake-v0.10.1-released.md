Version 0.10.1 of Cake has been released.

This hotfix release includes two bug fixes which were identified after our last release, and deemed serious enough to be corrected ahead of our upcoming 0.11.0 release.  In addition, we took the opportunity to improve the overall maintainability to readability of our own build.cake file.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
