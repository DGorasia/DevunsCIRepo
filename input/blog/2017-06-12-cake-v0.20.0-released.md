title: Cake v0.20.0 released
category: Release Notes

Version 0.20.0 of Cake has been released.

This release hopefully contains no new features!

But nevertheless it's the result of a great team effort.
With this release we've finally migrated from VS2015 and .NET Core preview bits and  _project.json_ to VS2017 / .NET Core SDK 1.0.4 and _csproj_.
This release also contains a few documentation improvements.

It's been a little more work than expected to get everything to compile and test successfully cross platform using the new SDK, but now the yak if finally shaved and we have an release out!

Our goal is for there to be no breaking changes with this build, but there's certainly a risk of that as changing underlying SDK and build tooling is a substantial move of cheese.

This is why we always recommend you pin the version of Cake you're running to avoid any unplanned broken builds. You can read more about pinning Cake version [here](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version).


Huge thanks to all Cake contributors and users, Cake wouldn't have been possible without you!

### Known issue

The Cake's dependency `NuGet.Core` has been updated from `2.12.0` to `2.14.0`, these means that if you're using an earlier version of `NuGet.Core` as a reference or addin in your build scripts you'll as reported issue [#1642](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/1642) get an error while executing the script, thanks [danwalmsley](https://github.com/danwalmsley) for reporting!

The solution is to update to use same version as shipped with Cake i.e.
```cake
#addin "nuget:?package=NuGet.Core&version=2.12.0"
```
gets changed to
```cake
#addin "nuget:?package=NuGet.Core&version=2.14.0"
```
and the make sure any old version of `NuGet.Core` is removed from your addin folder.
