Version 0.26.1 of Cake has been released.

This is a bug fix release.  After releasing 0.26.0 last week, it was noted that when running Cake on Mono, it wasn't possible to load netstandard 2.0 assemblies.  Since this will impact a number of users, we decided to release a fix for this as soon as possible.

Contributions were included from:

- [gep13](https://github.com/gep13)
