Version 0.15.1 of Cake has been released.

Following the release of Cake v0.15.0 a couple days ago, a problem was identified with regard to the AppVeyor functionality of uploading artifacts and pushing test results.

Fortunately, [Philo](https://github.com/Philo) identified the issue very quickly and submitted a PR request to correct the problem.

As a result, v0.15.1 of Cake is now available.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.
