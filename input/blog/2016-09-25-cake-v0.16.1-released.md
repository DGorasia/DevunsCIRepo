Version 0.16.1 of Cake has been released.

Following the release of Cake v0.16.0 last week, [mholo65](https://github.com/mholo65) identified an issue with debugging in Visual Studio Code.  In addition, we also noticed that we were missing some properties in the generated assemblies.

As a result, v0.16.1 of Cake is now available.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.
