Version 0.26.0 of Cake has been released.

The second release of 2018 is here! This release brings you the long awaited .NET Core 2 support. A special thanks goes to [Adam Hathcock](https://github.com/adamhathcock) for all the hard work with the contribution. 

One of the benefits in moving to .NET Core 2 is that addin authors should no longer need to target both `net46` and `netstandard1.6` in order to support `Cake` and `Cake.CoreCLR`. Instead addins should now be able to target `netstandard2.0` only and still be compatible with both `Cake` and `Cake.CoreCLR`. At the time of writing, we are experiencing an [issue](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/2063) with loading `netstandard2.0` assemblies when running `Cake` on `mono`. We are currently investigating this and will provide a hotfix once the issue is resolved.

While working on this release, we introduced a [breaking change](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/commit/02632b675a5f50d19231dfc33e5f003e8eb9498c#diff-55631c5d6cc133447feb92b62eb77118) in one of the interfaces in `Cake.Core`. Because of that, we bumped the [latest breaking change](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/commit/02632b675a5f50d19231dfc33e5f003e8eb9498c#diff-85a96088153087f031e3c4fd629acc4d) version number to 0.26.0. In practice this means that `Cake` will not load addins targeting a lower version than 0.26.0 of `Cake.Core`. This is by design and for your protection. Even though the breaking change should be compatible with the majority of the addins out there. one can never be sure. However, if you really need to use an incompatible addin and have verified that the breaking change introduced doesn't concern the addin directly, we'll allow you to temporarily opt-out of the assembly verification until addin author has released a version of the assembly targeting the minimum required version of `Cake.Core`. See the [skip verification](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/default-configuration-values#skip-verification) configuration value for more details.
