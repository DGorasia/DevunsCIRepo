Version 0.22.1 and 0.22.2 of Cake have been released.

Following the release of Cake 0.22.0 the 13th of September, an issue with the GitVersion alias and deserializing certain integer properties the tools output was uncovered, and the decision was taken to quickly correct it.

A little too quickly, but fortunately David Driscoll caught, reported and supplied a pull request quickly, so huge thanks for that!

In these releases it's corrected in a non breaking way and for the next release these properties will be corrected from integer to nullable integers, which potentially will be a breaking change for anyone using those properties.

And as always thanks to all Cake contributors and users, Cake wouldn't have been possible without you!
