Version 0.11.0 of Cake has been released.

There has been a lot of improvements and bug fixes in this release, but other than that we've been mostly focused on getting proper integration tests in place to better find regressions in future versions of Cake.

We've also (finally) added overloads for the Setup/Teardown methods that provides an `ICakeContext`. The old methods will now output an obsoletion warning, so you may want to think about updating the usage of those in your build scripts sooner rather than later.
