As you might have heard at the Microsoft [Connect()](connect2015.visualstudio.com/) event yesterday, both VS Code and Visual Studio Team Services (formerly Visual Studio Online) now both support Extensions.

## Cake VS Code Extension

You can find the Cake extension for VS Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/cake-build.cake-vscode).  Getting it installed is very simple, and full steps can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery?pub=cake-build&ext=cake-vscode).

Once it is installed, you will have full syntax highlighting available for *.cake files:

Huge thanks go to [Rob Prouse](https://github.com/rprouse) for both [suggesting this extension](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/530) and for doing most of the hard work to create it in the first place. Thanks!

## Cake Visual Studio Team Services Extension

You can find the Cake extension for Visual Studio Team Services [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/cake-build.cake).  To get started with using the extension, simply click the "Install" button.

Once installed, you will have the option to add a new Cake Build Step into your process:
