Version 0.24.0 of Cake has been released.

As a little holiday gift from the Cake team and contributors, the last version for 2017 just shipped!
This release shouldn't have any breaking changes, but it does have several improvements, bug fixes, and a couple new features.

A notable new feature is module bootstrapping built into the Cake script runner, which lets you download and install modules from NuGet with a `#module` preprocessor directive in your build script, similar to what you've previously already been able to do with `#tool` and `#addin`.

```cake
#module nuget:?package=Cake.UrlLoadDirective.Module&version=1.0.2
```

The only caveat is that as modules can change and extend the internals of Cake, this bootstrapping needs to be done before Cake executes. This is solved by bootrapping being it's own step by invoking Cake with a `--bootstrap` argument before you execute the script normally.

```bash
./cake.exe build.cake --bootstrap
./cake.exe build.cake
```

Notable amongst the improvements is that we've upgraded to Roslyn 2.6.1 which gives you [C# 7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-2) support in your Cake scripts.

And as always thanks to all Cake contributors and users, Cake wouldn't have been possible without you!
