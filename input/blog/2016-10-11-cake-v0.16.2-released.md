Version 0.16.2 of Cake has been released.

Following the release of Cake v0.16.1, [Redth](https://github.com/Redth) identified an issue with Cake not being identified as a .NET assembly when launched from a Mono process. With the help of [akoeplinger](https://github.com/akoeplinger) we identified the issue in the Mono runtime and the PE32+ format assemblies generated by Roslyn/csc.exe when targeting x64 (_which is the default in .NET Core project.json toolchain_). [akoeplinger](https://github.com/akoeplinger) has already submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/3745) to Mono for this, so we expect this to be fixed in future versions of Mono, meanwhile the workaround is to set platform to use _AnyCPU_ explicitly in the _project.json_ file.

As a result, v0.16.2 of Cake is now available.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
