This release has mostly been about improving the performance of file
and directory globbing, but one or two features and bug fixes managed
to sneak in as well.

We've also added support for
[using alias directives](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664765(v=vs.71).aspx)
which might be useful if you're having problems with conflicting type names.
However, this feature only works with the Roslyn based script engine
at the moment due to a bug in the Mono compiler.
An [issue have been filed](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=32894)
to Xamarin's bug tracker about this.
