Version 0.19.0 of Cake has been released.

This release of Cake is a smaller release in preparation for upgrading Cake itself to utilize latest RTM .NET SDK and Visual Studio 2017. The goal for v0.20.0 is also to unify around one scripting engine - Roslyn version 2.0 and depreciating the Mono scripting engine, this will likely result in raising the minimum supported version of .NET and Mono. We will before next release document and communicate exact versions.

We strongly recommend you pin the current version of Cake your using to avoid any unplanned interruption in your builds as the result of any potential future breaking changes. The [Pinning Cake Version](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version) under the tutorials section of our website describes how to achieve this with the default bootstrappers.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.

Once again, the Cake Team have been overwhelmed by the number of contributions from our Community Members.  Simply put... THANK YOU!
