Version 0.14.0 of Cake has been released.

We are very happy to announce the first release of Cake as a member of the .NET Foundation.  If you missed this announcement, you can read more about it [here](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/06/cake-joins-dotnetfoundation).

In this release, we made a number of improvements and squashed some bugs which had been reported.  In addition, we saw four new features added to Cake, including support for the Wix Heat command line tool, and also for Octopus Deploy Push command.

**NOTE:** Within this release, we also had one breaking change, namely the removal of the obsoleted XmlPoke Aliases.  These had been marked as obsolete in a previous release of Cake, and we have now taken the steps to remove them completely.  Cake does follow the semantic versioning principles, however, since we have not yet reached the 1.0.0 release, this breaking change appears here, in a minor version number change.
