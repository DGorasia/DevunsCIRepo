Cake v0.5.1 is now available on Homebrew!

Since the release process to Homebrew can't be automated (what I know of)
and requires approval by the Homebrew team, expect new releases to
appear a couple of days after they've been released on NuGet.

```
brew update
brew install cake
```

Credits go to [Jonathan Dick](https://github.com/Redth) for
making this possible.
