Version 0.15.2 of Cake has been released.

Hot on the heels of the 0.15.1 release, we have just finished another bug fix release.  This time, it was to correct two issues that were identified with the WiX aliases within Cake.

Both of these issues were identified and corrected by community members, and we would like to thank [galpin](https://github.com/galpin) and [RLittlesII](https://github.com/RLittlesII) for their help.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.
