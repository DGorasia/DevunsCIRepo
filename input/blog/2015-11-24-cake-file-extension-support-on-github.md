The Cake Team are very proud to announce that the .cake file extension has now become a first class citizen on the GitHub Website.  Starting today, your \*.cake files will now appear with full syntax highlighting, in the came way that your \*.cs files currently do.

Huge thanks have to go to Jonathan Dick (a.k.a [Redth](https://github.com/Redth)) who has been instrumental in getting the .cake file extension support in GitHub.

As a result of his hard work, instead of seeing your build.cake file looking like this:

You will now see it looking like this:

If you are interested in following the process that was taken to get this support, you can find the GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/2707).
