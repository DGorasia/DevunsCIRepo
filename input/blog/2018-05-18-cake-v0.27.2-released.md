Version 0.27.2 of Cake has been released.

This is a hotfix release of Cake.  Following the release of Cake 0.27.1 we discovered additional problems with assembly and dependency loading. Luckily, [Dave Glick](https://github.com/daveaglick) was kind enough to step up and (hopefully) squash these bugs once and for all.

Contributions were included from:

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.
